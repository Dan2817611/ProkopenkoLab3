The study of rainbows is the subject of research in optics and meteorology.Scientists study the processes that occur in rain drops and light scattering for a better understanding of the formation of rainbows.
Rainbow is a wonderful natural phenomenon that fascinates with its beauty and magic.Looking at the rainbow, we can feel calm and hope that they always accompany this miracle of nature.
